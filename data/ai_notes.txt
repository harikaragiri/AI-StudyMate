Artificial Intelligence enables machines to simulate human intelligence. Machine Learning is a subset of AI that allows systems to learn from data. Supervised learning uses labeled data, while unsupervised learning finds patterns without labels.

Neural networks are inspired by the human brain and consist of input, hidden, and output layers. Deep learning uses multi-layer neural networks.

RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) combines vector search with language models to generate accurate answers from external knowledge.
