Java is an object-oriented programming language. Key OOP concepts include Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction. A class is a blueprint for objects, and an object is an instance of a class.

Inheritance allows one class to acquire properties of another. Polymorphism allows methods to behave differently based on object type. The JVM executes Java bytecode.

Exception handling in Java uses try, catch, and finally blocks to manage runtime errors.
