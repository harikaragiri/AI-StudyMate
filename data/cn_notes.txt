Computer Networks allow computers to communicate and share resources. TCP is connection-oriented and reliable, while UDP is connectionless and faster but unreliable. OSI Model has 7 layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.

IP addressing uniquely identifies devices in a network. DNS translates domain names into IP addresses. HTTP is used for web communication, while HTTPS adds encryption for security.

Routing protocols like RIP, OSPF, and BGP determine best paths for data transmission.
